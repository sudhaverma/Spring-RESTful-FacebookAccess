# Spring-RESTful-FacebookAccess
Recently, I implemented a Spring application that uses Twitter's APIs to allow you to post tweets on your timeline, find top 20 tweets, earch by hashtag and so on. This got me excited and this application now will use Facebook's API to do more interesting things with the data that facebook shares. You can find the Spring twitter application [here](https://github.com/sudhaverma/Spring-RESTtful-Twitter-Application).

# Plan 

I have realized that if I write down the plan for the application before a line of code is written, it keeps me more focused. So here goes a tentative plan about the minimum number of features I want to add to this Spring facebook application: 

* Get a user's data (duh!)
* Show the user information in a better visualization. For e.g 
*   Show all locations the user has lived in on a nice map. 
*   Show the number of friends, and how that number has grown on a pretty graph. 
*   Use a good graph library to draw more graphs! Visualize the data better! 
*   Allow a user to post on his/her own timeline.
